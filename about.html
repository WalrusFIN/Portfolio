          <p>
            I am a 23-year-old English language expert from Jyväskylä, Finland. During my studies at the University of Jyväskylä
            I majored in English language while also studying information systems and information technology as minor subjects. 
            In 2017 I also spent a semester studying in the Netherlands as an exchange student. Both my language and IT-skills were
            highly useful in my previous job as a translator for a Finnish IT-company. I am aiming to be employed in a position
            where I can utilise both my language and IT-skills, as well as my international experience.

          <h3>Translator, 6.2019 - 1.2020</h3>
          <h4>Samlink</h4>
          <p>
            During my time at Samlink I translated various materials from Finnish to English. The materials included test cases
            for testing netbanking services and various other texts related to both IT and finance. In this position I was given
            a great deal of responsibility in carrying out my translations, which required great attention to detail and good 
            time management skills.

          <h3>Festival volunteer, 06.2019</h3>
          <h4>Midnight Sun Film Festival</h4>
          <p>
            I took part in organising the film festival as a volunteer in Sodankylä, Finland. During the festival I learned how 
            a large international event such as the festival is organised from the point-of-view of the organiser, while on my free-time I was able 
            to attend the festival. My tasks also included customer service and cashier work.

          <h3>Translator trainee, 2.2018 - 4.2018</h3>
          <h4>Finnish Ski Association</h4>
          <p>
            In this short internship I translated the Finnish Ski Associations instructional materials used for organising
            outdoors events for children and elementary school students. During this internship I learned professional communication 
            when interacting with my supervisor as well as how to translate Finnish-language texts into English.
