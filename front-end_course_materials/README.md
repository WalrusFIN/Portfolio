The portfolio is divided into five pages. 
The home-page contains only my name, title, social media links, a background image and a navigation button.
The about-page contains information about me, my studies and work experience as well as an image of myself.
In the studies-page you can view my most important four studies. In the desktop version you can read more about each by clicking the boxes on the left.
The my work-page contains five links to my work and projects, as well as relevant links for each, for example to github.
Finally the contact-page contains my email and phone number.
