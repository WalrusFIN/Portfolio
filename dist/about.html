          <p>
            I am a 23-year-old English language expert from Jyväskylä, Finland. During my studies at the University of Jyväskylä
            I majored in English language while also studying information systems and information technology as minor subjects. 
            In 2017 I also spent a semester studying in the Netherlands as an exchange student. Both my language and IT-skills were
            highly useful in my previous job as a translator for a Finnish IT-company.

            During my time at Samlink I translated various materials from Finnish to English. The materials included test cases
            for testing netbanking services and various other texts related to both IT and finance. In this position I was given
            a great deal of responsibility in carrying out my translations, which required great attention to detail and good 
            time management skills.
